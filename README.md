# GitHub

A repository for organizing my existing repositories and presenting a call to action for collaborators

## Collaborators

Below are a list of projects that I am actively seeking collaboration on. Please feel free to check them out, contribute and ask questions about any of the below:

1. [Bootstrapping](https://github.com/knathanieltucker/bootstrapping) (or perhaps better named: computational statistical inference in python). I am building out a bootstrapping library for data scientists. Very early stages.
2. Causal Inference python library. I would like to eventually build something like this out, but I have not even started. If interested please reach out.
3. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQTQ0AbOupKNxKKY-_x46OQ). We are always interested in help with various parts of the channel (you can check out some of the [videos and repos](#youtube-material) below)
4. Data science projects. I love to help out on new data sets and if all goes well we could make a [Data Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Aimp4i5M0c) together.
5. Deep Learning Research. I have more ideas than I have time to implement, so if you know what you are doing (or have gone through my tutorial at [A Bit of Deep Learning and Keras](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgJhDSE2ZLxaPX0jteHZG4skdj8ZrST9d)) I would love to work together
6. And as always I do **Data Science Consulting** for those with more serious data problems

## Course Material

Below are repositories associated with courses that I teach. Feel free to reach out to me (or subscribe to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/knatetucker)) if you would be interested in attending these or getting further information.

4. [Introduction to Data Science 2016](https://github.com/ga-students/ds-sf-29)

## Speaking Engagements

0. Planning on speaking at at the [Big Data Conference](http://www.globalbigdataconference.com/santa-clara/6th-annual-global-big-data-conference/event-105.html) about the real problems in data science
1. I spoke on representational learning at [ODSC West](https://odsc.com/california) (Video edit in progress)
2. I spoke on representational learning at Demystifying Artificial Intelligence

## Contracts

A list of a couple of contractor projects that I have worked on:

1. I taught machine learning, data science and python to students at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com) with [Develop Intelligence](https://www.developintelligence.com)
2. Helped develop machine learning models for [Autumn Wind Asset Management](https://www.autumnwind.com)
